## The Evolution of AI-Assisted Development

I have been using VS Code with GitHub Copilot for development purposes. The introduction of text-based chat, which brought GPT capabilities directly into the IDE, was revolutionary. 

### GitHub Copilot and the Local Tools Gap

GitHub Copilot has revolutionized how developers write code by providing intelligent code suggestions and completions. While it excels at understanding code context and generating relevant snippets, there has been a notable gap in its ability to interact with local development tools, intranet KBs, and execute actions in the development environment. This limitation means that while Copilot can suggest code, it cannot directly help with tasks like running commands, managing files, or interacting with local services.

### Agent Mode: Bridging the Gap

The introduction of Agent Mode in GitHub Copilot represents a significant step forward in AI-assisted development. It enables Copilot to:
- Execute terminal commands
- Modify files directly
- Interact with the VS Code environment
- Handle project-specific tasks

This advancement transformed Copilot from a passive code suggestion tool into an active development partner that can help manage your entire development workflow. While tool execution capabilities brought many advantages, they also came with some inherent challenges. Issues such as maintaining tool code, implementing authentication, and managing authorization capabilities created additional overhead for developers. 

### MCP: The New Standard for AI Tool Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as the next evolution in this space, providing a standardized way for AI models to interact with development tools and services. Unlike traditional approaches where AI assistants are limited to suggesting code, MCP enables:

1. **Direct Tool Integration**
   - AI models can directly invoke local tools
   - Real-time interaction with development environment
   - Standardized communication protocol

2. **Extensible Architecture**
   - Custom tool definitions
   - Plugin-based system
   - Easy integration with existing services

3. **Development Environment Awareness**
   - Context-aware assistance
   - Access to local resources
   - Real-time feedback loop

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification that enables AI models to interact with external tools and services in a standardized way. It defines how tools can expose their functionality through a structured interface that AI models can understand and use.

Key benefits of MCP that I have personally benefited from:
- Standardized tool definitions with JSON Schema
- Real-time interaction capabilities
- Session management
- Built-in VS Code integration

[More about MCP Architecture Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

### How MCP Tools Work

Each MCP tool follows a standardized structure:

```javascript
{
  name: "toolName",
  description: "What the tool does",
  parameters: {
    // JSON Schema definition of inputs
  },
  returns: {
    // JSON Schema definition of outputs
  }
}
```

When an AI model wants to use a tool:
1. It sends a request with the tool name and parameters
2. The MCP server validates the request
3. The tool executes with the provided parameters
4. Results are returned in a standardized format

This structured approach ensures:
- Consistent tool behavior
- Type safety throughout the system
- Easy tool discovery and documentation
- Predictable error handling

## Architecture Overview

Here's how the different components interact in our MCP Todo implementation:

```

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you'll need:
- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- VS Code
- Basic understanding of Express.js
- npm or yarn package manager

## Setting Up the Project

1. First, create a new project and initialize npm:

```bash
mkdir mcp-todo-server
cd mcp-todo-server
npm init -y
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk express lowdb zod
```

For this demonstration, we're using lowdb to manage tasks in a JSON file without actual integration with an external system. In a production environment, the lowdb functions can be replaced with actual JIRA CRUD API calls for end-to-end implementation. 

3. Create the basic directory structure:

```
mcp-todo-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Implementing the MCP Server

### 1. Basic Server Setup

We started with a basic Express server that implements the MCP protocol. The server uses StreamableHTTP for real-time communication and session management.

Key components in `server.js`:
- Express server setup
- MCP SDK integration
- StreamableHTTP transport configuration
- Session management for maintaining tool state

### 2. Database Configuration

We used lowdb, a lightweight JSON database, to persist our todos. The database configuration in `config/db.js` handles:
- JSON file storage
- Basic CRUD operations
- Data persistence between server restarts

### 3. Implementing Todo Tools

We implemented four main tools for managing todos:

1. **createTodo**
   - Creates new todo items
   - Validates input using Zod schema
   - Returns the created todo with a unique ID

2. **listTodos**
   - Lists all todos or filters by completion status
   - Formats output for easy reading
   - Supports real-time updates

3. **updateTodo**
   - Updates todo completion status
   - Validates input parameters
   - Returns updated todo information

4. **deleteTodo**
   - Removes todos by ID
   - Provides completion confirmation
   - Handles error cases gracefully

## VS Code Integration

To enable VS Code to use our MCP server, follow these steps:

1. Enable Agent mode in VS Code. Click on the drop down just before the model listing and select agent from it. 

![Enable Agent Mode in VS Code](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/1-enable-agents.png)

2. Then click on the Gear icon next to the speaker icon in the above image and select "Add more tools" then select "Add MCP Server"

![Add MCP Server](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/2-add-mcp-server.png)

3. Then select HTTP or Server-Sent Events and provide the URL based on the server we created. In this case, it's http://localhost:3000. Then select a name for the server.

![Select HTTP or Server-Sent events](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/3-select-http.png)

![Provide name](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/5-provide-name.png)

![Select settings](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/6-user-settings.png)

4. Alternatively you can Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the Command Palette. Type "Open Settings (JSON)" and select it and add the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "my-mcp-server": {
                "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
You can use the 4th step to verify if the server is added correctly after the first 3 steps are done. The User Settings option has Start, Stop, and Restart options. This step helped me identify if there are any issues with the MCP tools server effectively.

![Settings JSON](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/8-settings.json_.png)

5. Reload VS Code to apply the changes or use the Start, Stop, Restart options in the settings.json as shown above. 

6. After successful addition of the MCP server, you should see the tools listed when you click the gear icon in the Copilot chat window.

## Using the Todo MCP Server

Here are some example prompts you can use in VS Code with GitHub Copilot to interact with the todo server. Each example includes a screenshot of the actual interaction:

1. **Creating a Todo**
   ```
   Prompt: "Create a new todo item called 'Review PR #123'"
   Response: Successfully created todo "Review PR #123"
   ```
   ![Creating a new todo](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/1.1-request-todo.png)
   ![Execute Add](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/1.2-existing-list.png)
   ![Create TODO success](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/1.3-create-success.png)

2. **Listing Todos**
   ```
   Prompt: "Show me all my todos"
   Response: Here are your todos:
   - Review PR #123 (Not completed)
   - Update documentation (Completed)
   - Setup test environment (Not completed)
   ```

   ![Listing all TODOs](https://itechgenie.com/myblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/todo-list-all.png)  

3. **Updating a Todo**
   ```
   Prompt: "Mark the todo about PR review as completed"
   Response: Updated "Review PR #123" to completed
   ```

4. **Deleting a Todo**
   ```
   Prompt: "Delete the todo about documentation"
   Response: Successfully deleted "Update documentation"
   ```

5. **Filtering Todos**
   ```
   Prompt: "Show me only completed todos"
   Response: Completed todos:
   - Review PR #123
   ```
